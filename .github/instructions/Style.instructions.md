# Guidelines for STYLING

## TAILWIND

- Use the @layer directive to organize styles into components, utilities, and base layers
- Implement Just-in-Time (JIT) mode for development efficiency and smaller CSS bundles
- Use arbitrary values with square brackets (e.g., w-[123px]) for precise one-off designs
- Leverage the @apply directive in component classes to reuse utility combinations
- Implement the Tailwind configuration file for customizing theme, plugins, and variants
- Use component extraction for repeated UI patterns instead of copying utility classes
- Leverage the theme() function in CSS for accessing Tailwind theme values
- Implement dark mode with the dark: variant
- Use responsive variants (sm:, md:, lg:, etc.) for adaptive designs
- Leverage state variants (hover:, focus:, active:, etc.) for interactive elements

## SCSS

- Use the ThemeProvider for consistent theming across components
- Implement the css helper for sharing styles between components
- Use props for conditional styling within template literals
- Leverage the createGlobalStyle for global styling
- Implement attrs method to pass HTML attributes to the underlying DOM elements
- Use the as prop for dynamic component rendering
- Leverage styled(Component) syntax for extending existing components
- Implement the css prop for one-off styling needs
- Use the & character for nesting selectors
- Leverage the keyframes helper for animations
